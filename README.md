# fractal

Project fr_fract'ol for 42 School

Mine has 5 types of fractols and supports multiple windows: see them all by calling ./fractol 1 2 3 4 5

- Spacebar to reset the view
- Esc to exit
- Command to freeze-frame Julia
- Click to zoom - that's the best way. Otherwise you can use the scroll wheel but be careful to steer with your mouse position.
- Arrow keys will also move side to side.
- Plus and minus will zoom on the center of the screen.
- Best Part: Press "C" to toggle color modes, and then x or v to change the color offset!! Enjoy!
